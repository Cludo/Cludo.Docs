<h2 id="introduction_region">Regions</h2>

When self-implementing Cludo through our API it is important to know what region you are located in.

At Cludo we have two API's one for US Customers and one for EU Customers. 

<aside class="notice">
If you are in doubt of what region you are located in you can check your customerId. If it's an 8-digit number you are located on the US API.
