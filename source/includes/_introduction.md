# Introduction

Welcome to the Cludo API!

You can use our API to do searches, access your statistics, and manage pretty much anything related to your service. In short - all functionality found in My Cludo can be achieved through the API.

<aside class="notice">We're actively working on improving and expanding our API documentation. If you have any questions or feedback, we'd love to <a href="https://www.cludo.com/contact/" target="_blank">hear from you</a>.</aside>

<aside class="warning">Some features don't work out of the box without using the Cludo JavaScript. You will have to do your own implementation of [quicklinks](#tools_quicklinks) and [tracking](#tracking).</aside>
