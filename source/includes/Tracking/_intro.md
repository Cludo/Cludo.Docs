Tracking is important, otherwise it is hard to adapt your search to fit your users needs, therefore Cludo provides tracking of searches and clicked search results.

<aside class="warning">
Tracking implementation is only required if you **don't** use the CludoJS script.

When tracking, you may log search queries, and search result clicks.
