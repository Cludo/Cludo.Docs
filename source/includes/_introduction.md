# Introduction

Welcome to the Cludo API! You can use our API to both do searches and access your statistics.

The documentation is a work in progress, and not all API calls are documented yet. All calls which can be found in the dashboard can be called and accessed from the API.

<aside class="warning">Some features don't work out of the box without using the Cludo JavaScript. You will have to do your own implementation of Quick links and the tracking of search results.</aside>
